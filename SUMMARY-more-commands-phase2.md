# Summary Report: Phase 2 Commands Implementation + Git Switch (June 2025)

## Overview
Successfully implemented Phase 2 from `PLAN-more-commands.md` - adding undo support for four medium-complexity git operations focused on repository state management and commit manipulation. Additionally implemented dedicated support for `git switch` as a modern alternative to `git checkout`. This expansion increases git-undo's command coverage from 11 to 16 supported operations (45% increase from Phase 1).

## ‚úÖ Commands Implemented

### 1. `git reset` - Repository State Reset Undo
**Command**: `git reset [--soft|--mixed|--hard] [commit]`  
**Undo Method**: Reflog-based state restoration to previous HEAD position  
**Implementation**: `internal/git-undo/undoer/reset.go`

**Features**:
- **Smart Mode Detection**: Automatically detects soft, mixed, or hard reset modes
- **Reflog Integration**: Uses git reflog to find previous HEAD position before reset
- **Mode-Appropriate Restoration**: Matches original reset mode in undo operation
- **Safety Warnings**: Warns users about potential data loss in hard reset scenarios

**Reset Mode Support**:
- **`--soft`**: Undo with `git reset --soft <previous_head>` (preserves index and working tree)
- **`--mixed`** (default): Undo with `git reset <previous_head>` (preserves working tree)  
- **`--hard`**: Undo with `git reset --hard <previous_head>` (restores all state, warns about data loss)

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Missing HEAD commit (repository initialization)
- Insufficient reflog history (new repositories)
- Staged/unstaged change detection and warning generation
- Malformed reflog entries

### 2. `git revert` - Reverse Commit Undo
**Command**: `git revert [--no-commit] <commit>`  
**Undo Method**: Remove revert commit or reset staged revert changes  
**Implementation**: `internal/git-undo/undoer/revert.go`

**Features**:
- **Commit Pattern Recognition**: Identifies revert commits by message patterns and reflog entries
- **Dual Mode Support**: Handles both committed reverts and `--no-commit` scenarios
- **Safe Restoration**: Uses soft reset to preserve working directory and staging area
- **State Preservation**: Maintains uncommitted changes during undo operation

**Operation Modes**:
- **Committed Revert**: `git reset --soft HEAD~1` (removes revert commit, preserves changes)
- **Staged Revert** (`--no-commit`): `git reset --mixed HEAD` (unstages revert changes)

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- Non-revert commit detection and rejection
- Missing parent commit scenarios  
- Working directory change preservation
- Revert commit message validation

### 3. `git cherry-pick` - Commit Application Undo
**Command**: `git cherry-pick [--no-commit] <commit>`  
**Undo Method**: Remove cherry-pick commit or abort ongoing operation  
**Implementation**: `internal/git-undo/undoer/cherry_pick.go`

**Features**:
- **Operation State Detection**: Detects ongoing cherry-pick conflicts vs completed operations
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handles cherry-pick conflicts with `--abort` operation
- **Commit Verification**: Validates cherry-pick commits using reflog and commit messages
- **Change Preservation**: Maintains staged/unstaged changes during undo

**Operation Scenarios**:
- **Completed Cherry-pick**: `git reset --soft HEAD~1` (removes commit, preserves changes)
- **Staged Cherry-pick** (`--no-commit`): `git reset --mixed HEAD` (unstages changes)
- **Ongoing Cherry-pick**: `git cherry-pick --abort` (cancels conflicted operation)

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- CHERRY_PICK_HEAD state detection
- Non-cherry-pick commit identification
- Commit message pattern matching ("cherry picked from commit...")
- Missing parent commit scenarios

### 4. `git clean` - Untracked File Removal Undo
**Command**: `git clean [-f|-fd|-n|...]`  
**Undo Method**: **Not Supported** (requires proactive backup system)  
**Implementation**: `internal/git-undo/undoer/clean.go`

**Current Status**: **Intentionally Limited**
- **Dry-run Detection**: Identifies and rejects `--dry-run` operations (no undo needed)
- **Clear Error Messages**: Provides educational error messages about git clean limitations
- **Future Framework**: Establishes architecture for potential backup-based undo system

**Design Philosophy**:
```go
// Git clean permanently removes untracked files that were never in git's database.
// Unlike other git operations, these files cannot be recovered from git's internal state.
// Future enhancement would require pre-operation backup hooks.
```

**Future Enhancement Path**:
- Pre-operation backup system integration
- Timestamp-based backup management  
- Selective file restoration capabilities
- Hook system modification for before-operation triggers

### 5. `git switch` - Modern Branch Switching Undo
**Command**: `git switch [branch]` or `git switch -c <new-branch>`  
**Undo Method**: `git switch -` (return to previous) or branch deletion for creation  
**Implementation**: `internal/git-undo/undoer/switch.go`

**Features**:
- **Modern Git Support**: Full compatibility with git switch (Git 2.23+)
- **Branch Creation Support**: Handles `-c`/`--create` and `-C`/`--force-create` flags
- **Smart Branch Switching**: Returns to previous branch using `git switch -`
- **Safety Warnings**: Comprehensive change detection and user guidance

**Operation Modes**:
- **Branch Creation** (`-c`/`--create`): `git branch -D <branch>` (delete created branch)
- **Force Creation** (`-C`/`--force-create`): `git branch -D <branch>` with overwrite warning
- **Branch Switching**: `git switch -` (return to previous branch with conflict warnings)

**Edge Cases Handled**:
- No previous branch scenarios (new repository)
- Uncommitted changes detection (staged/unstaged/untracked)
- Force branch creation overwrites (with appropriate warnings)
- User guidance for conflict resolution scenarios

```

### Advanced Implementation Patterns

#### 1. **Reflog-Based State Tracking** (`reset.go`)
```go
// Get the reflog to find the previous HEAD position
reflogOutput, err := r.git.GitOutput("reflog", "-n", "2", "--format=%H %s")
previousLine := strings.TrimSpace(lines[1])
parts := strings.SplitN(previousLine, " ", 2)
previousHead := parts[0]
```

#### 2. **Commit Pattern Recognition** (`revert.go`, `cherry_pick.go`)
```go
// Multi-layered commit validation
commitMsg, _ := r.git.GitOutput("log", "-1", "--format=%s", "HEAD")
if !strings.HasPrefix(commitMsg, "Revert") {
    reflogMsg, _ := r.git.GitOutput("reflog", "-1", "--format=%s")
    if !strings.Contains(reflogMsg, "revert") {
        return ErrInvalidOperation
    }
}
```

#### 3. **State Preservation Warnings**
```go
// Check for staged changes that would be preserved
stagedOutput, err := git.GitOutput("diff", "--cached", "--name-only")
if err == nil && strings.TrimSpace(stagedOutput) != "" {
    warnings = append(warnings, "This will preserve staged changes")
}
```

### Core Integration Enhancements
- **Factory Pattern Extension**: Updated `undo_command.go` with 5 new command routes (including switch)
- **Error Handling Consistency**: Maintains `ErrUndoNotSupported` patterns
- **Git Command Recognition**: Enhanced `git_reference.go` to include modern git switch
- **Safety-First Design**: Extensive validation and user warning systems
